// Analyze interleaved accesses and collect them into interleaved load and
// store groups.
//
// When generating code for an interleaved load group, we effectively hoist all
// loads in the group to the location of the first load in program order. When
// generating code for an interleaved store group, we sink all stores to the
// location of the last store. This code motion can change the order of load
// and store instructions and may break dependences.
//
// The code generation strategy mentioned above ensures that we won't violate
// any write-after-read (WAR) dependences.
//
// E.g., for the WAR dependence:  a = A[i];      // (1)
//                                A[i] = b;      // (2)
//
// The store group of (2) is always inserted at or below (2), and the load
// group of (1) is always inserted at or above (1). Thus, the instructions will
// never be reordered. All other dependences are checked to ensure the
// correctness of the instruction reordering.
//
// The algorithm visits all memory accesses in the loop in bottom-up program
// order. Program order is established by traversing the blocks in the loop in
// reverse postorder when collecting the accesses.
//
// We visit the memory accesses in bottom-up order because it can simplify the
// construction of store groups in the presence of write-after-write (WAW)
// dependences.
//
// E.g., for the WAW dependence:  A[i] = a;      // (1)
//                                A[i] = b;      // (2)
//                                A[i + 1] = c;  // (3)
//
// We will first create a store group with (3) and (2). (1) can't be added to
// this group because it and (2) are dependent. However, (1) can be grouped
// with other accesses that may precede it in program order. Note that a
// bottom-up order does not imply that WAW dependences should not be checked.
