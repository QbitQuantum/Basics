        If we are a fly forward type vehicle (eg plane), then in-air status can be determined through a combination of speed and height criteria.
        Because of the differing certainty requirements of algorithms that need the in-flight / on-ground status we use two booleans where
        onGround indicates a high certainty we are not flying and inFlight indicates a high certainty we are flying. It is possible for
        both onGround and inFlight to be false if the status is uncertain, but they cannot both be true.

        If we are a plane as indicated by the assume_zero_sideslip() status, then different logic is used

        TODO - this logic should be moved out of the EKF and into the flight vehicle code.
