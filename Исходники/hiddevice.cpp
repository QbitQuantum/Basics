    /*
            Before we can "connect" our application to our USB embedded device, we must first find the device.
            A USB bus can have many devices simultaneously connected, so somehow we have to find our device, and only
            our device.  This is done with the Vendor ID (VID) and Product ID (PID).  Each USB product line should have
            a unique combination of VID and PID.

            Microsoft has created a number of functions which are useful for finding plug and play devices.  Documentation
            for each function used can be found in the MSDN library.  We will be using the following functions:

            SetupDiGetClassDevs()					//provided by setupapi.dll, which comes with Windows
            SetupDiEnumDeviceInterfaces()			//provided by setupapi.dll, which comes with Windows
            GetLastError()							//provided by kernel32.dll, which comes with Windows
            SetupDiDestroyDeviceInfoList()			//provided by setupapi.dll, which comes with Windows
            SetupDiGetDeviceInterfaceDetail()		//provided by setupapi.dll, which comes with Windows
            SetupDiGetDeviceRegistryProperty()		//provided by setupapi.dll, which comes with Windows
            malloc()								//part of C runtime library, msvcrt.dll?
            CreateFile()							//provided by kernel32.dll, which comes with Windows

            We will also be using the following unusual data types and structures.  Documentation can also be found in
            the MSDN library:

            PSP_DEVICE_INTERFACE_DATA
            PSP_DEVICE_INTERFACE_DETAIL_DATA
            SP_DEVINFO_DATA
            HDEVINFO
            HANDLE
            GUID

            The ultimate objective of the following code is to call CreateFile(), which opens a communications
            pipe to a specific device (such as a HID class USB device endpoint).  CreateFile() returns a "handle"
            which is needed later when calling ReadFile() or WriteFile().  These functions are used to actually
            send and receive application related data to/from the USB peripheral device.

            However, in order to call CreateFile(), we first need to get the device path for the USB device
            with the correct VID and PID.  Getting the device path is a multi-step round about process, which
            requires calling several of the SetupDixxx() functions provided by setupapi.dll.
