	// Well, if you find the normal to a triangle, you are finding a "Face Normal".
	// If you give OpenGL a face normal for lighting, it will make your object look
	// really flat and not very round.  If we find the normal for each vertex, it makes
	// the smooth lighting look.  This also covers up blocky looking objects and they appear
	// to have more polygons than they do.    Basically, what you do is first
	// calculate the face normals, then you take the average of all the normals around each
	// vertex.  It's just averaging.  That way you get a better approximation for that vertex.
