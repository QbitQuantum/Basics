		 * Update the crc.  Try to do it in parallel with the inner
		 * loop.  'crc' is used to accumulate crc0 and crc1
		 * produced by the inner loop so that the next iteration
		 * of the loop doesn't depend on anything except crc2.
		 *
		 * The full expression for the update is:
		 *     crc = S*S*S*crc + S*S*crc0 + S*crc1
		 * where the terms are polynomials modulo the CRC polynomial.
		 * We regroup this subtly as:
		 *     crc = S*S * (S*crc + crc0) + S*crc1.
		 * This has an extra dependency which reduces possible
		 * parallelism for the expression, but it turns out to be
		 * best to intentionally delay evaluation of this expression
		 * so that it competes less with the inner loop.
		 *
		 * We also intentionally reduce parallelism by feedng back
		 * crc2 to the inner loop as crc0 instead of accumulating
		 * it in crc.  This synchronizes the loop with crc update.
		 * CPU and/or compiler schedulers produced bad order without
		 * this.
		 *
		 * Shifts take about 12 cycles each, so 3 here with 2
		 * parallelizable take about 24 cycles and the crc update
		 * takes slightly longer.  8 dependent crc32 instructions
		 * can run in 24 cycles, so the 3-way blocking is worse
		 * than useless for sizes less than 8 * <word size> = 64
		 * on amd64.  In practice, SHORT = 32 confirms these
		 * timing calculations by giving a small improvement
		 * starting at size 96.  Then the inner loop takes about
		 * 12 cycles and the crc update about 24, but these are
		 * partly in parallel so the total time is less than the
		 * 36 cycles that 12 dependent crc32 instructions would
		 * take.
		 *
		 * To have a chance of completely hiding the overhead for
		 * the crc update, the inner loop must take considerably
		 * longer than 24 cycles.  LONG = 64 makes the inner loop
		 * take about 24 cycles, so is not quite large enough.
		 * LONG = 128 works OK.  Unhideable overheads are about
		 * 12 cycles per inner loop.  All assuming timing like
		 * Haswell.
