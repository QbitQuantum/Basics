     * The server's well-known port (13 for the daytime service) is bound
     * to the socket by filling in an Internet socket address structure and
     * calling bind(). We specify the IP address as INADDR_ANY, which allows
     * the server to accept a client connection on any interface, in case
     * the server host has multiple interfaces.
     *
     * 以普通用户运行该程序时,会报错: bind error: Permission denied
     * 此时,错误码是EACCES. 查看man bind手册,对该错误码解释为:
     * EACCES The address is protected, and the user is not the superuser.
     *
     * 在Linux中,只有 root 用户可以绑定 1024 以下的端口.
     * 查看 man 7 ip 手册,里面有如下说明:
     * The port numbers below 1024 are called privileged ports (or
     * sometimes: reserved ports). Only privileged processes (i.e., those
     * having the CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE capability) may bind to these sockets
     * 所以运行该程序时,要用root用户或者sudo命令来运行.
     * 另外, 13 这个端口可能被占用导致绑定不成功. Linux下,查看端口是否被占
     * 用的方法是: netstat -apn | grep <端口号>. 例如: netstat -apn|grep 13
