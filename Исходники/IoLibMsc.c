/**
  Reads a 16-bit I/O port.

  Reads the 16-bit I/O port specified by Port. The 16-bit read value is returned.
  This function must guarantee that all I/O read and write operations are
  serialized.

  If 16-bit I/O port operations are not supported, then ASSERT().
  If Port is not aligned on a 16-bit boundary, then ASSERT().

  @param  Port  The I/O port to read.

  @return The value read.
